First, create a BankAccount class that has the following properties:
AccountNumber (string)
AccountType (string)
Balance (decimal)
OwnerName (string)
Create a SavingsAccount class that inherits from BankAccount and adds the following properties:
InterestRate (decimal)
Create a CheckingAccount class that inherits from BankAccount and adds the following properties:
MonthlyFee (decimal)
MinimumBalance (decimal)
Create an interface called ITransferable that has a Transfer method that takes in two BankAccount objects and a decimal representing the amount to transfer.

Modify the BankAccount class to implement the ITransferable interface, adding the following Transfer method:

The method should check if the account has sufficient funds to transfer the requested amount, and if not, throw an exception.
The method should deduct the amount from the current account's balance and add it to the target account's balance.
Create an abstract class called BankTransaction with a method called ExecuteTransaction that takes in two BankAccount objects and a decimal representing the amount to transfer.

Create two subclasses of BankTransaction called DepositTransaction and WithdrawTransaction.

DepositTransaction should add the specified amount to the specified account's balance.
WithdrawTransaction should subtract the specified amount from the specified account's balance.
Create a static class called BankTransactionFactory that has two methods:
CreateDepositTransaction, which returns a new instance of DepositTransaction.
CreateWithdrawTransaction, which returns a new instance of WithdrawTransaction.
Create a complex method called TransferFunds that takes in two BankAccount objects and a decimal representing the amount to transfer.
The method should create a new instance of WithdrawTransaction using BankTransactionFactory.CreateWithdrawTransaction and pass in the source account and amount to withdraw.
The method should then create a new instance of DepositTransaction using BankTransactionFactory.CreateDepositTransaction and pass in the target account and the withdrawn amount.
Finally, the method should call the ExecuteTransaction method on both transactions to complete the transfer.
Here's some sample code to get you started:
