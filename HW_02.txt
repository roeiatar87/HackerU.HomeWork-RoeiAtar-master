Hw 02:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Write a method that get array of strings and return the longest string 
-----
2. Write a method that get array of numbers and return a string of all numbers seperated with uderscore (example:2_3_4)
-----
3. Write a method name it Calculate that get 2 numbers and operator string (+/-/*/)
    int Calculate(int num1,int num2, string operator)
    the method will retutn avalue 
    Example:
    int x = Calculate(2,5,"+");
    x will be 7
  
    read the numbers and operator from user input 
    then call the Calculate method with the inputs as parameters 
    and print the result number
  
    
----
4. Write a method name it DitanceFromAvg 
  that get 2 parameters array of numbers (numbers) and a number (distanceAvg):
  
  List<int> DistanceFromAvg(int[] numbers,distanceAvg)
  
  the method will return a dynamic array of all numbers 
  that the distance from avg is less then the value of distanceAvg
  example:
 input parameters:
 10, 2, 38, 22, 38, 23, 21
 distanceAvg = 2
 
 avg is 22
 it should return: 21 22 23
 21 distance from 22  1
 22 distance from 22  0
 23 distance rom  22  1
 
 -----  
5. write a method that read from user string values dynamically (use List<string>) untill
  the user input the "exit" word 
  
  the method will print all strings in the list as uppercase from last to first
  print how many strings in the list
 -----
 6. write a method  that get list of numbers and print all numbers sorted (search google)
 -----
 7. write a method that read integers values into List
   each value must be between 0-100 
   if it is not between 0-100 the value should not added to the list
   and user should read the number again
 ----  
8. write a method that get 2 parameters :
 -   list of strings (strings)  
 -   string (valuetoremove):              
   List<string> RemoveFromList(List<string> strings,string valuetoremove)     
 -   the method will remove all apperences of valuetoremove from the list
     and return a list witout the valurs removed
----     
9.   wtite a method that get decimal list of numbers 
    - the method will remove all numbers that are bigget then average
    - it will print the removed indexes
    - it will return the new list (after removing the numbers biggest then avg)
